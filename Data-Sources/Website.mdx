   - Maximum depth to ingest relative to the entered URL.
   - **Values**: 
     - `0`: Ingests only the entered URL.
     - `1`: Ingests the entered URL and all pages one level deep.
     - `2`: Ingests the entered URL and all pages up to two levels deep.
     - **Note**: Higher values follow the same pattern.

- #### Includes
   - URL patterns to include in the ingestion. Only URLs matching these patterns will be ingested.
